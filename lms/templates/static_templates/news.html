<div class="heading">Teaching Grows Into 21ST Century</div>

<div class="content">
<b>Education</b> is going through a long awaited transformation due to advances in technology and discoveries in brain sciences—neuroscience and cognitive science. One of the major developments is in learning units that are created with an understanding of how brain processes, stores, and retrieves information. This understanding is informed by the research in neuroscience and cognitive science.<br>
Past decade has seen a deeper understanding by scientists of how our brain works. This new knowledge about our brain has turned many of long standing beliefs about teaching upside down. It follows that the traditional method of sequential teaching does not lead to long lasting deep learning that is required for solving complex and practical problems. Students are often fed information that is stored in their working memory until the exams and it is flushed out of the working memory after the exams. Once flushed out this information is no more accessible to the student.
<br>
The memory unit called long-term memory by memory researchers is the key to deep learning that is required for real progress in a student's education. Unless information, skills, and processes are stored in the long-term memory student will find it difficult to learn new knowledge,  retrieve and apply the information and skills they have supposedly gained, and will fail to solve complex problems that are often hallmark of various competitive exams. Most of us have been through the experiences where we thought we had learned something only to find during the revision that everything felt new again! Using brain research terminology this could be seen as a failure of information movement from working memory into the long term memory. The translation requires biochemical changes in brain that do not happen in sufficient manner with many of the sequential pattern of teaching followed by most of the educational institutions today.<br>

<span id="moreText1" style="display:none">
<br>
In recent times, experts and scientists have started to formulate strategies that can help translate important findings about brain structures and processes into practical strategies that can be used to build learnings units. Primary contributors to this movement are the School of Education at the world renowned and top ranked Johns Hopkins Medical School, USA and Professor Terrence Seznowski of Howard Hughes Medical Center, USA and Professor Barbara Oakley Oakland University, USA.<br>
<br>
Brain Targeted Teaching (BTT) format built by the school of education at the Johns Hopkins University identifies six components of creating a learning unit that incorporates many of the latest findings from brain sciences. According to Neuroscientists human brain is  evolving bio-chemically during periods of deep and long lasting learning. Researchers are able to label regions of the brain that are instrumental at different stages of learning. For example, it is now known that the information is first encountered in a brain region dedicated to emotional processes and then transmitted to the region linked to the thinking processes. A clear implication of this finding is that under stress, threat, and other negative emotions, information will be short circuited into the emotional region and will not flow completely into the thinking region, a pre-requisite for deep learning and long term memory building. This is quite easily seen in everyday life when people who are angry or under stress are often unable to make rational decisions as their ability to think clearly is impaired.<br>
<br>
The six components of BTT are Climate, Environment, Design, Mastery, Application, and Evaluation. Each component includes a major research finding in neuroscience, its impact on learning, and recommendations on creating a learning unit that avoids negatives and re-enforces positive impacts.<br>
<br>
<b>Climate</b> of stress, threat, and fear impedes deep learning and long term memory building by short circuiting information into emotional region of the brain known as limbic system. It is a poignant reminder of the climate that many of us lived through our childhood when beatings were a common method to “discipline” students. Generations have been subjected to such treatment during their school years. Current research findings completely destroy the claim that such methods of punishment could have benefited any student. In  fact, they are pointing towards the destruction caused in lives of countless number of students who could not build long term memories of important subjects, skills, and processes during their childhood and carry those lifelong deficiencies which will forever inflict damage on them and their families.<br>
<br>
Now we know based on scientific evidence that a climate of fear and stress is counterproductive to a child or adult's learning every effort should be made to mitigate this issue. Corporal punishment such as beatings may not be as common in schools today but other forms of stress has entered into lives of students. This is a sad reality that often rears its head in coaching centers like Kota. As educators and parents it is our responsibility to ensure that students are not being put under pressure of unreasonable expectations, unnecessary stress of travel, and stress of managing their life when the most important thing for their learning and future is a climate of love and nurture and constant communication to help them deal with their fears and stress.<br>
<br>
<b>Environment</b> has an important role to play in learning as majority of brain's sensory inputs come through the eyes. Researchers have found that brain's visual reception is strongly influenced by the newness or novelty of the environment. Classroom experiments have shown that frequently changing and adjusting display led to more student engagement as opposed to bland unchanging environments where students quickly switched off their mind from the class. This is not a surprising finding as most of us have experienced the same boredom when presented with drab, boring, and unchanging tasks. However, this finding is critical for learning because majority of class rooms are bland and unchanging environments where day after and day and teacher after teacher uses same teaching techniques and tools thus creating a constant hum of drab teaching that is hard to focus on even by the best students. It is important to note, though, that this is not a criticism of the teacher as such but a criticism of the teaching environment.<br>
<br>
Teachers should create a rich and vibrant learning environment by application of imagery and technology. This will keep students engaged for longer period, hence, re-enforcing long term memory and deep learning. Researchers have also shown that achievement of students increases when they are taught in natural and full spectrum of lighting rather than cool-white fluorescent lights also known as tube-lights which are all pervasive in our learning centers.<br>
<br>
<b>Design</b> of learning experience should take a holistic approach by presenting students with the overarching learning goals early and often. Brain classifies every piece of information into familiar and novel and then processes the information to create  new patterns of thinking and understanding. Ignoring this fact is like trying to solve a jig-saw pule without seeing the overall image first. In such kind of learning students end up learning disconnected bits of information that does not translate into patterns of understanding and are not of much use later.<br>
<br>
Teachers should provide dynamic concept maps through the use of technology to students and use these maps as a guide while moving through a learning unit. This helps students in developing learning patterns that are goals of the unit and helps student use their learning in solving higher order complex problems that require integration of various ideas in the learning unit.<br>
<br>
<b>Mastery</b> of skills, content , and concepts is fundamental goal of the learning activity. Cognitive scientists have identified three memory systems. Short-term memory lasts from a few seconds to minutes and it is used for a temporary storage enabling routine tasks as remembering phone numbers, addresses, or any piece of information that is used immediately. Working memory is storage that works like a desktop where information is kept for a few days and then flushed out of brain once it is used for a near term task. This memory is often used by students when they cram before the exams. Students memorize and store a large amount of information by working hard right before exam, retrieve information from working memory during the exam and then brain forgets that information when exam is over. A majority of us are familiar with cramming before exams but not many know that we forgot most of what we had learned because the long-term memory did not store the information.<br>
<br>
Storage in the long-term memory requires rehearsal and repetition of information. It is important to note that simply re-reading same information will not help much as most of what was learned in the previous reading will have only been stored in the working memory and lost by the time you re-read it. Rehearsal and repetition should account for the novelty of method as discussed in design component before. Students should be presented with the same information in multiple ways and at a reasonable interval which depends on how long memory has to be retained in mind. Teachers should make use of technology to create multiple audio and visual formats; they should also provide varied activities that require recall of  content being learned.<br>
<br>
<b>Application</b> is the higher-order learning goal that comes after mastery of skill and it is also hallmark of effective teaching. Real objective of education is to build skills, retain content, and master processes so that the students are able to apply the acquired knowledge in analyzing, creating, and evaluating new knowledge.<br>
<br>
Students should engage in inductive and deductive reasoning, analysis, and problem solving tasks in the context of real-world applications. Such tasks force students to apply higher-order processes such as analyzing, evaluating, and creating knowledge. Such activities may include conducting investigations, designing experiments, creating metaphors and analogies, and examining cause and effect patterns.<br>
<br>
<b>Evaluation</b> is used to provide students with immediate feedback so that they can adjust their learning habits and strengthen learning and memory patterns. Frequent evaluation and feedback also deliver efficiency improvements as students can keep their learning task on most productive path without diverging too far.<br>
<br>
It is hard to provide feedback to a large number of students on a frequent basis. However, such feedback is critical to students' success as they have limited time to complete every grade and finish studying for competitive exams. Think of letting someone drive in an unknown forest without telling them where they are and where they stand in relation to beginning and the end. The less frequent such feedback the more are the chances that they will never reach their destination on time. Technology can play an important role here as such feedback can be programmed to be given with appropriate frequency and can be tailored to the need of individual student.<br>
<br>
Fruits of modern science are too expensive to ignore. We owe it to our children and students. Our children are growing in a knowledge economy where skills gained in school and college are more important than ever before. Those who are unable to build these skills will find survival hard in the knowledge economy. It is not going to be the world with which most of the teachers and parents are familiar with. It is not sufficient to send children to good schools, coaching, or provide them with latest books and gadgets. A fundamental shift in thinking is needed in how technology is used in providing most effective and efficient learning experience. Competition is going to the world class and it is high time that our education system grows into the 21st century to provide 21st century skills to our students.<br>

<b>I find it difficult to focus and study for long hours. I am unable to understand Math and English. I avoid studying until the last moment.

Last two decades have seen an explosive growth in Information and Communication Technology. Today we have come to take for granted services such as Facebook, Google, Whats-app, Video Streaming services like YouTube, and a lot more. Oh! yes, of course who can forget ubiquitous smartphones. These services and devices were simply inconceivable for most of us only a decade back.  <br>
<br>
Even though the fruits of modern science and technology are being enjoyed by ever larger world population it is noteworthy that the quality and breadth of services significantly vary among different regions of the world. Some of the variation is definitely due to different level of infrastructure that often takes large investments and years to complete. Variations in other fields such as education are harder to explain.   <br>
<br>
In words of Professor Jeffrey D. Karpicke of Duke University – one of the top ranked Universities in the USA and world- <span class="italic_content">“What’s surprising is that a lot of learners use ineffective and inefficient strategies. In my laboratory, for example, we have surveyed college students about their learning. They most commonly use the strategy of repeated reading— simply reading through books or notes over and over. We and other researchers have found that this passive and shallow strategy often produces minimal or no learning. We call this “labor in vain”— students are putting in labor but not getting anywhere. We don’t engage in passive rereading because we are dumb or lazy. We do it because we fall prey to a cognitive illusion. When we read material over and over, the material becomes familiar and fluent, meaning it is easy for our minds to process. We then think that this easy processing is a sign that we have learned something well, even though we have not.”</span>

Advances in brain sciences--neuroscience and cognitive science--have led to some startling discoveries about how our brain works. One of the most amazing discoveries of brain science is that you can change your brain for better and do things that you, your teachers, and family thought were impossible. This discovery has an important implication that if you follow a scientifically proven process of learning grounded in modern scientific theory you have a much better chance of being successful in your competitive exams.<br>
<br>
It was long thought that we were born with our brain in the sense that our intelligence level was fixed. This seemingly simple and widely accepted idea has led to rejection of a vast majority of students as average students, not good enough to compete in top end exams. If a student does not focus on her studies, or is not good at math or english, or is not in the top end of her class, it is assumed that her future as a student is not bright. However, this idea has been turned on its head by discoveries in brain sciences that show that the human brain is capable of reorganizing itself and changing all the time. Consequently, you can change the composition of your brain if you follow some simple techniques that have been derived from scientific theories as opposed to anecdotal evidence that often lie at the core of many of the learning techniques currently in use by students around the world.<br>
<br>
Teaching methodologies of 21st century should be based on an application of current theories in neurosciences and cognitive psychology. They should be used to develop learning techniques that lead to construction of a holistic learning experience for students. This holistic experience will be empathetic to a student's current skill level, environment, and goals. In contrast, current methodologies adopted by modern educational institutions including coaching that include those at the top end of spectrum focus on methods often based on anecdotes, personal experiences, and recycled traditional methods.<br>
<br>
Neurosciences and Cognitive Psychology are highly advanced fields as they go beyond what is taught at a the post graduate level in medical schools. For a long time their discoveries remained hidden behind tomes of scientific literature that targeted experts in these fields rather than the teachers, parents, and  students who could be one of its ultimate beneficiaries. It is only recently that a few academicians in United States have started to translate these theories into a language that is understood by the people who are outside these specializations.In Particular, work by scholars such as Dr. Terry Seznowski of Howard Hughes Medical Center and Prof. Barbara Oakley of Oakland University is noteworthy in helping students adapt to simple but counter-intuitive, efficient, effective, and exceptionally powerful learning techniques.	 <br>
<br>
To put things in perspective let's talk about procrastination—the habit of delaying a task that needs to be accomplished, an issue which by some measures is faced by more than 70% of adults. Procrastination is now understood by neuroscientists as a response to perceived pain arising from a task by a specific region of the brain. Once an individual is faced with a task that activates regions of brain associated with pain she tries to switch to another region of brain that is associated with pleasure. For example, every time a student tries to solve a tough homework she ends up checking her facebook messages or talking to friends on phone. Parents and teachers often think that the student is not serious enough and lacks a drive to succeed in school. However this is completely untrue as by some estimates more than 70% of students have a tendency to procrastinate. Admittedly, most of the parents and teachers will also agree that they also procrastinate when faced with a task that is perceived to be unpleasant. <br>
<br>
Students who procrastinate are often asked to use their willpower to force themselves to finish apparently unpleasant tasks such as solving math problems. Researchers have found that frequent use of willpower is a loosing proposition as it is a limited resource and spending it on a frequent issue such as procrastination is going to hurt the student more than it will help her. A better solution will be one that employs brain's natural tendencies rather than fighting it. One such scientifically proven solution is to focus on process rather than the goal. To focus on process, a technique described thoroughly by Professors Seznowski and Oakley is to use pomodoro technique.  <br>
<br>
Pomodoro is an ancient technique which is simple to use. In pomodoro technique student is expected to study in units of twenty five minutes followed by complete break from her studies for some time which may range from five to ten minutes. In this break she can reward herself by doing any of the tasks she would normally do to enjoy her time. One key to this method is that the twenty five minutes must be spent only on studying and in a place that is completely free of distractions--no mobile phones or TV should be nearby. By repeating this process student can study for longer hours. Her focus on process rather than the goal which is primary cause of activation of pain in brain regions ensures that she avoids the perceived pain of the task. As student becomes better at the subject she enjoys studying it more and perhaps sufficient enough to be able to study the subject for longer hours without pain regions of brain kicking off.  <br>
<br>
It should be noted that the pomodoro technique is almost costless and very simple to understand and apply. But that does not mean that a student will apply it correctly even if she knows about this technique. The reason is that procrastination is a habit hard to deal with. It is also possible that the pomodoro technique is not correctly applied by the student and she will often fall back into the trap of procrastination. It is not possible to monitor the student so as to help her by pointing out when she falls back into the trap of procrastination. Technology can be used to accomplish accurate application of the technique. Course content can be broken into small self contained units that have logical breaks which lead to natural breaks for student. If a unit is designed to complete within twenty five minutes then student will have a natural break in her study after twenty five minutes. Such breaks are often an invitation to stop studying for some time and then pick up a new unit after the break. If student does not take that break the device can make a note of that and prompt student to take the break. <br>
<br>
Most students face several difficulties in their studies such as procrastination, forgetting, lack of focus, inability to learn difficult concepts, inability to understand and memorize for long term use, and overconfidence. A typical response to such issues is to blame the student. Latest research in neuroscience and cognitive science is showing that this situation may be due to factors out of conscious control of the student. Furthermore, there are scientific evidence based simple solutions many of the aforementioned problems. These solutions  can be incorporated into the learning units by use of technology.<br>
<br>
What if your child or student does not fear math, science, and english; she often looks forward to learning; she finds that she can remember most of what she learned and she can confidently apply her knowledge in solving new and complex problems! There is hope for every student no matter what their skill level. Every student can improve their performance by application of modern science based learning techniques that have been proven by top experts.
